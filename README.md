# Udacity Project 1: Personal Portfolio
The first project for Udacity's Frontend Developer Nanodegree.

The intention is to design a page that looks like [this one](https://d17h27t6h515a5.cloudfront.net/topher/2017/November/5a136147_design-mockup-portfolio/design-mockup-portfolio.pdf).

The project is designed to be a single page site, leveraging Bootstrap CSS and JS. To improve the learning experience, all development was done locally using Node, Express and Browsersync.
